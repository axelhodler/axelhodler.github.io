Sometimes I get asked _"What is your favorite programming language?"_, _"What programming language would you use when starting to learn programming?"_, _"What do you think of programming language X?"_, _"What programming languages do you use?"_.

I regard these questions as waste standing on their own. If used as small talk and thus as an entrypoint to a conversation? Fine. Let me elaborate.

I got taught __Delphi__ in school. Can't really remember too much about it. The programming was done through some kind of interface builder. In university I got to do Prolog and Java. Back then one was able to use Java a lot because Android was quite new and Android apps were written in Java.

Later, after getting suggested some prominent YouTube lectures, I was able to play with Scheme. Python was added when a course on using MongoDB relied on it. Especially the [bottle](https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/) framework. Python was also the first language where I wrote tests. Later Python was used throughout the "Programming Bitcoin" using jupyter notebooks. Due to working with AngularJS at my first job I was able to pick up some JavaScript. JavaScript stuck with me and it is what I use today if I need to create a quick scripts using Node.js. By getting into Angular at my second job I was able to work with TypeScript.

By following the Ethereum ecosystem for a while I got to do some programming with __Solidity__. The smart contract programming language of choice.

After spending way too much time on [hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/), and seeing the sentiment repeated again and again, how every programmer should know Assembly and C I went through a PDF for Assembly and the beginning of [Learn C the Hard Way](https://learncodethehardway.org/c/). Back then the book was free and not yet finished.

After functional programming started to become all the rage I got my feet wet in Clojure by spending some time with the book [Clojure for the Brave and True](https://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/). Later Haskell by working through half of the [haskell book](https://haskellbook.com/).

By following the TDD and Clean Code community I was able to see a lot of Ruby in presentations and code snippets. Ruby was later revisted by working through Programming Languages Part A, Part B and Part C by Dan Grossman [on coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages). The course also made you code in ML and Racket.

In 2018 I had the fortune to introduce Kotlin into a pure Java codebase. Instead of resistance the change was welcomed with open arms by fellow developers. Both the possibility to learn something new, and be paid for it, and also the ability to write less code.

Kotlin is what I use to this day in most backend related work. As Rust became popular, and was supposed to be the new C, I did spend some time with the book [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

While getting into iOS development I was able to quickly pick up Swift and SwiftUI.

I once read the statement you are only able to state you know a certain programming language if you are able to write [Fizz buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) in it. A low bar. It will only prove we remember the basic syntax. I would be able to write Fizz buzz in Java, Kotlin, JavaScript, Swift and Python. Mainly because I used all of the recently. For all the others I would have to brush up my knowledge for a few minutes.

How do you learn a programming language then? You don't need to know generics to write a simple Java command line application. Neither the difference between `class` and `struct` before writing an iOS app in Swift. It will become apparent at one point in your journey. Just when you need it.

Neither do you need to read a book on the programming language. You might pick up a few tricks while reading it and remember parts of the codebase you can apply it to.

In my day to day work I am sometimes asked _"Would this syntax work here?"_. Even when you know the answer (Yes/No) the better answer is _"Let's write a test and see". The moment you have a test we can play around with the implementation details, learn what works and iteratively improve it if necessary.

So what is my favorite programming language?

I don't have one. This saves some time when discussing what to use for a new project. What I care more about is the tooling around the language. I enjoy working more with Kotlin than with Swift because I consider IntelliJ to be superior to Xcode. While Xcode might be a lot easier than setting up your Haskell tooling. (To be fair it has been a while I have looked into Haskell tooling). Do I thus like Kotlin more than Swift because I enjoy working with it more? Fair enough, I guess the answer is yes.

What program language would you use when starting out to learn programming?

Depends on what you would want to do. The easiest might be where you have all the required tools, a browser, already installed. Thus JavaScript.

In the end it is all if, else, loops and pattern matching for the functionally inclined.


I reject the notion of "Do X to become a better programmer". To become a better programmer program.
