Sometimes I get asked "What is your favorite programming language?", "What programming language would you use to learn programming?", "What do you think of programming language `x`?", "What programming languages do you use?"

I got taught __Delphi__ in school. Can't really remember too much about it. The programming was done through some kind of interface builder. In university we got to do Prolog and Java. Back then we were able to use Java a lot because Android was quite new back then and Android apps were written in Java.

Later, by following some YouTube lectures, I was able to play with Scheme. Python was added when a course on using MongoDB relied on it. Especially the frameworks bottle and flask. I believe it is also the first language where I wrote tests. Python was also used throughout the "Programming Bitcoin" using jupyter notebooks. Due to working with AngularJS at my first job I was able to pick up some JavaScript. JavaScript stuck with me and it is what I use today if I need to create a quick scripts using Node.js. By getting into Angular at my second job I was able to work with TypeScript.

By following the Ethereum ecosystem for a while I got to do some programming with __Solidity__. The smart contract programming language of choice.

After spending way too much time on [hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/), and seeing the sentiment repeated again and again, how every programmer should know Assembly and C I went through a PDF for Assembly and the beginning of [Learn C the Hard Way](https://learncodethehardway.org/c/). Back then the book was free and not yet finished.

Got my feet wet in Clojure by spending some time with the book [Clojure for the Brave and True](https://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/) and Haskell by working through half of the [haskell book](https://haskellbook.com/). By following the TDD and Clean Code community I was able to see a lot of Ruby in presentations and code snippets. Ruby was later revisted by working through Programming Languages Part A, Part B and Part C by Dan Grossman [on coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages). The course also made you code in ML and Racket.

In 2018 I had the fortune to introduce Kotlin into a Java codebase. Instead of resistance the change was welcomed with open arms. Kotlin is what I use to this day in most backend related work. As Rust became popular, and was supposed to be the new C, I spend some time with the book [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

While getting into iOS development I was able to quickly pick up Swift.

I once wrote the statement you are only able to say you know a certain programming language if you are able to write [Fizz buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) in it. A low bar. It will only prove you remember the basic syntax. I would be able to write Fizz buzz in Java, Kotlin, JavaScript, Swift and Python. Mainly because I used all of the recently. For all the others I would have to brush up my knowledge for a few minutes.

How do you learn a programming language? You don't need to know generics to write a simple Java command line application. Neither the difference between `class` and `struct` before writing an iOS app in Swift. It will become apparent at one point in your journey.

You do not need to read a book on the programming language. You might pick up a few tricks while reading it and remember parts of the codebase you can apply it to.

You only need to write a test. "Does this work?" "I don't know, let's write a test"

So what is my favorite programming language?
