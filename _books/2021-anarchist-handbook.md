title: "The Anarchist Handbook - Michael Malice"
---

A collection of essays, speeches and blog posts by leading figures of the anarchist history. Both by anarchists rejecting private property and the ones that do not. Socialists and capitalists or left and right. What unites them is regarding the state as evil. Or at least as innefficient and disincentived in providing better services than the free market or at providing the service at all.

## Lysander Spooner

> As taxation is made compulsory on all, whether they vote or not, a large proportion of those who vote, no doubt do so to prevent their own money being used against themselves; when, in fact, they would have gladly abstained from voting

> The highwayman takes solely upon himself the responsibility, danger, and crime of his own act. He does not pretend that he has any rightful claim to your money, or that he intends to use it for your own benefit. He does not pretend to be anything but a robber.

## Johann Most

## Louis Lingg

> has become popularized as Lingg supposedly proclaiming, “I couldn’t have thrown that bomb. I was at home making bombs.”

> "You have charged me with despising “law and order.” What does your “law and order” amount to? Its representatives are the police, and they have thieves in their ranks. Here sits Captain Schaack. He has himself admitted to me that my hat and books have been stolen from him in his office—stolen by policemen. These are your defenders of property rights!"

> "I protest against the conviction, against the decision of the court. I do not recognize your law, jumbled together as it is by the nobodies of bygone centuries, and I do not recognize the decision of the court."

> "I despise you. I despise your order, your laws, your force-propped authority. Hang me for it!"

## Leo Tolstoy

The author of _War and Peace_ and _Anna Karenina_ was a committed anarchist.

> The destruction of government will, say they, produce the greatest misfortunes—riot, theft, and murder—till finally the worst men will again seize power and enslave all the good people. But not to mention the fact that all this—i.e. riots, thefts and murders, followed by the rule of the wicked and the enslavement of the good—all this is what has happened and is happening,

## Emma Goldman

Essay with praise for the individual and harsh critiques for _the masses_.

> Lacking utterly in originality and moral courage, the majority has always placed its destiny in the hands of others. Incapable of standing responsibilities, it has followed its leaders even unto destruction.

> Politically the human race should still be in the most absolute slavery, were it not for the John Balls, the Wat Tylers, the Tells, the innumerable individual giants who fought inch by inch against the power of kings and tyrants.

> The greatness and courage worshipped in Lincoln have been forgotten in the men who created the background for the panorama of that time.

> Lincoln and his minions followed only when abolition had become a practical issue, recognized as such by all.

> Yet how long would authority and private property exist, if not for the willingness of the mass to become soldiers, policemen, jailers, and hangmen.

The quote above displays her socialist background. The anarcho-capitalist would not regard "private property" as something bad. One might replace it with "unjust laws".

## Charles Robert Plunkett

A short essay proposing political violence

> When Free Speech is suppressed, when men are jailed for asking food, clubbed for assembling to discuss their grievances, and stoned for expressing their opinions, there is but one recourse—violence. The ruling class has guns, bullets, bayonets, police, jails, militia, armies and navies. To oppose all this the worker has only—dynamite.

> Off with the mask! This is war. Violence can be met only with violence. “If they attack us with cannon, we will attack them with dynamite”—and, whenever possible, let us attack first. To oppression, to exploitation, to persecution, to police, jails, militia, armies and navies, there is but one answer—DYNAMITE!

## Morris and Linda Tannehill

Insurance companies, covering loss of value by aggression, as an alternative for the current police and prison system.

> “An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,” which means: “When you destroy a value of mine, I’ll destroy a value of yours.” Present day penology no longer makes such demands; instead of the eye or the tooth, it takes the criminal’s life (via execution), or a part of his life (via imprisonment), and/or his possessions (via fines).

> Since a crime can only be committed against individuals, a criminal cannot be rationally regarded as “owing a debt to society,” nor can he “pay his debt to society:” the only debt he owes is to the injured individual(s).

> First, the insurance company’s representatives would attempt a voluntary settlement with the accused aggressor. If he was obviously guilty and the amount of reparations requested was just, it would be in his interest to agree to this settlement and avoid involving an arbitration agency, since the cost of any arbitration would be added on to his bill if he lost in his attempt to cheat justice.

> Any free-market business, including an arbitration agency, can survive and prosper only as customers choose to patronize it instead of its competitors. An arbitration agency must be chosen by both (or all) disputants in a case, which means that its record of settling previous disputes of a similar nature must be more satisfactory, to both complainant and defendant, than the records of its competitors. Any arbitration agency which consistently set reparations too high or too low in the opinion of the majority of its customers and potential customers would lose business rapidly. It would have to either adjust its payments to fit consumer demand ... or go out of business.

> loss of reputation, would be even more damaging to the aggressor. Just as specialized companies would keep central files, listing poor contractual risks, they would also list aggressors so that anyone wishing to do business with a man could first check his record. Insurance companies in particular would make use of this service. So our bank robber would find insurance companies listing him as a very poor risk and other firms reluctant to enter into contracts with him.

> The fear of a tyrant is a very real one, and, in the light of history, it is well justified. But, as can be seen from the foregoing examination, it applies to a governmentally run society rather than to a free society. The objection that a tyrant might take over is actually a devastating argument against government.

## David Friedman

Friedman goes through ways in which stateless societies defend themselves. Police and Military. The necessity for police would be greatly reduced by legalizing victimless crimes. Other disputes can be taken care of by private security agencies. An alternative to the military would be an armed militia - People that do firearm training in their free time and pay for their own equipment already do exist. So do folks playing paintball in their free time.

## Murray Rothbard

David Friedman focusses on implementation details, the inefficiencies of the state. Rothbard on "the virulent reign of the State".

> Therefore, the chief task of the rulers is always to secure the active or resigned acceptance of the majority of the citizens.

> The intellectuals are, therefore, the “opinion-molders” in society. And since it is precisely a molding of opinion that the State most desperately needs, the basis for age-old alliance between the State and the intellectuals becomes clear.

> The State, on the other hand, is willing to offer the intellectuals a secure and permanent berth in the State apparatus; and thus a secure income and the panoply of prestige.

> For while individual persons tend to indulge in “selfish greed,” the failure of the State’s rulers to engage in exchanges is supposed to signify their devotion to higher and nobler causes—parasitic predation being apparently morally and esthetically lofty as compared to peaceful and productive work.

> For if a judicial decree of “unconstitutional” is a mighty check to government power, an implicit or explicit verdict of “constitutional” is a mighty weapon for fostering public acceptance of ever-greater government power.

> A man is drafted, though he finds nothing in the Constitution about being drafted. . . .

> A man goes to the federal penitentiary for saying what he wants to, and he paces his cell reciting . . . “Congress shall make no laws abridging the freedom of speech.”

> While social power is over nature, State power is power over man.

## John Hasnas

While anarchy is often regarded as lawlessness, or "without rules", the word anarchy literally means "without rulers". Hasnas makes the argument why "objective" law does not exist in our current governments.

> [...] is both an incoherent concept and a utopian fantasy impossible to put into practice.

Law is inherently political and the constitution can be interpreted as the current ruling class seems fit.

## Michael Malice

On why he does not vote and does not intend to. Because:

> [...] governments will continue to act regardless of any sort of popular approval – and certainly regardless of any approval of mine. State action proceeds independently of any democratic justification.

> George W Bush did the same thing when he sought United Nations authority to invade Iraq in 2003. Having seen that the votes were not there, he simply grounded his invasion in earlier resolutions.

> the vote was a formality; an ex-post-facto justification for an organization to do whatever it intended to do anyway.
