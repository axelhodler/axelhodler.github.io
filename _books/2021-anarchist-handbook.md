# Chapter 19 - David Friedman

Friedman goes through ways in which stateless societies defend themselves. Police and Military. The necessity for police would be greatly reduced by legalizing victimless crimes. Other disputes can be taken care by private security agencies. An alternative to the military would be an armed militia - People that do firearm training in their free time and pay for their own equipment already do exist. So do folks playing paintball in their free time.

# Chapter 20 - Murray Rothbard

David Friedman focusses on implementation details. Rothbard on "the virulent reign of the State".

> Therefore, the chief task of the rulers is always to secure the active or resigned acceptance of the majority of the citizens.

> The intellectuals are, therefore, the “opinion-molders” in society. And since it is precisely a molding of opinion that the State most desperately needs, the basis for age-old alliance between the State and the intellectuals becomes clear.

> The State, on the other hand, is willing to offer the intellectuals a secure and permanent berth in the State apparatus; and thus a secure income and the panoply of prestige.

> For while individual persons tend to indulge in “selfish greed,” the failure of the State’s rulers to engage in exchanges is supposed to signify their devotion to higher and nobler causes—parasitic predation being apparently morally and esthetically lofty as compared to peaceful and productive work.

> For if a judicial decree of “unconstitutional” is a mighty check to government power, an implicit or explicit verdict of “constitutional” is a mighty weapon for fostering public acceptance of ever-greater government power.

> A man is drafted, though he finds nothing in the Constitution about being drafted. . . .

> A man goes to the federal penitentiary for saying what he wants to, and he paces his cell reciting . . . “Congress shall make no laws abridging the freedom of speech.”

> While social power is over nature, State power is power over man.

# Chapter 21 - John Hasnas

While anarchy is often regarded as lawlessness, or "without rules", the word anarchy literally means "without ruler". Hasnas makes the argument why even having "objective" law does not exist in our current governments.

> [...] is both an incoherent concept and a utopian fantasy impossible to put into practice.

Law is inherently political and even the constitution can be interpreted as the current ruling class seems fit.

# Chapter 22 - Michael Malice

On why he does not vote and does not intend to. After all:

> [...] governments will continue to act regardless of any sort of popular approval – and certainly regardless of any approval of mine. State action proceeds independently of any democratic justification.

> George W Bush did the same thing when he sought United Nations authority to invade Iraq in 2003. Having seen that the votes were not there, he simply grounded his invasion in earlier resolutions.

> the vote was a formality; an ex-post-facto justification for an organization to do whatever it intended to do anyway.
