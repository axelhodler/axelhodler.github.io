A great book to give to your product owner or non-technical folks in the organization. As a developer one will mostly nod while reading the book. While not necessarily learning a huge amount, aside from lots of trivia on Twilio and tech history, it provides some fine arguments that can be used in discussions.

> customers suddenly did care about the software that companies used because the customers directly interfaced with it. If you had a better website or mobile app than your competition, it would be a good reason for customers to pick you.

> with off-the-shelf software apps, you have to change your business to match the softwareâ€”which is crazy! Really, you should change the software to build the business your customers need.

> ING would own the code, so developers could improve their system as often as they wanted, rolling out new code every day if need be, instead of waiting for a commercial vendor to ship an upgrade maybe once or twice a year.
