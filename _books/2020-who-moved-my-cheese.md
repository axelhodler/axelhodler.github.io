Quick read. One can go through it in about an hour. The content is a parable which divides people into four categories depending on how they react to change. Some adapt quickly, some slowly and some don't.

The gist is one should not resist change even if the adaption phase is hard.

> The fastest way to change is to laugh at your own folly - then you can let go and quickly move on

> for if you do not adapt in time, you might as well not adapt at all

Personally I found it weird how the characters who reacted best to the changes in the parable were the `simple` mice. The slow ones were the `intelligent` humans.

Especially as the book seems to be given out to employees by management. Leaving one with some kind of `don't think too much, just adapt` mantra.
