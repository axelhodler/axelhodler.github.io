title: "Spark of Life - Erich Maria Remarque"
---

Set in a Nazi concentration camp during the final months of Nazi Germany. The main protagonist is the prisoner 509. He is referred to as a number. 509. It is a low number as he was one of the first prisoners and has spent the last decade in the camp. A political prisoner. Neither a communist nor a nazi. A newspaper editor against totalitarianism.

Increasing air raids in the city near the camp and the news the Americans have crossed the Rhine at Remagen spark new hope in the prisoners and doubt in the guards.

The following Friedrich Nietzsche quote is befitting:

> "He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how."

On the other hand we have the director of the camp, Neubauer, who piece by piece loses the status and wealth he has built during the Nazi reign.
