Pre-modernism (Medievalism) dominated the West from 400 CE to 1400 CE, was ended by the Enlightenmend, bringing Modernism. Followed by the more recent Postmodernism.

> Metaphysically, postmodernism is anti-realist, holding that it is impossible to speak meaningfully about an independently existing reality.

> Epistemologically, having rejected the notion of an independently existing reality, postmodernism denies that reason or any other method is a means of acquiring objective knowledge of that reality

> "Truth" is a myth. "Reason" is a white male Eurocentric construct. "Equality" is a mask for oppressions.

Focault: "reason, [...] is the ultimate language of madness"
Stanley Fish: "relieves me of the obligation to be right ... and demands only that I be interesting."

> [...] many wanted to reinvigorate the German traditions of faith, duty, and ethnic identity that had been undermined by the Enlightenment’s emphasis upon reason, the pursuit of happiness, and cosmopolitanism.

> Of the five major features of Enlightenment reason—objectivity, competence, autonomy, universality, and being an individual faculty—Kant rejects objectivity.

> The irrationalists divided over whether religion is true—Schleiermacher and Kierkegaard being theists, and Schopenhauer and Nietzsche being atheists—but all shared a contempt for reason. All condemned reason as a totally artificial and limiting faculty, one that must be abandoned in the bold quest to embrace reality

> Nietzsche - Reason is a tool of weaklings who are afraid to be naked in the face of a cruel and conflictual reality and who therefore build fantasy intellectual structures to hide in.

> In contrast to Schleiermacher, Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche, then, Kant and Hegel seem like champions of reason. Yet Kantian and Hegelian assumptions launched the irrationalist move-ments of the nineteenth century.

> The death of Nietzsche in 1900 brings us to the twentieth century. Nineteenth-century German philosophy had developed two main lines of thought—the speculative metaphysical and the irrationalist epistemological. What was needed was a way to bring together these two strands of thought into a new synthesis for the next century. The philosopher who accomplished this was Martin Heidegger.

> Heidegger [...] is unquestionably the leading twentieth-century philosopher for the postmodernists. Derrida and Foucault identify themselves as followers of Heidegger.
