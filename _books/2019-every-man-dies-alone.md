Set during World War 2 in Berlin. A couple loses their son at the front during the fighting with France. Soon they decide to write messages in defiance of tyranny onto postcards and distribute them anonymously in Berlin.

The reader will meet multiple characters who deal with the situation at the time in their own way.

A great read. Especially the character of Dr. Reichhardt, the musician, and the development of detective Escherich.
