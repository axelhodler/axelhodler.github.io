I found myself providing the following articles and videos multiple times
to people curious about the topic. Every time I had to search for the resource
and link to it with a comment. The following is an attempt to save some time by aggregating all
the resources I'm repeatedly going back to.

The recording [How to Stop Hating your Test Suite by Justin Searls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VD51AkG8EZw)
contains a primer on everything related to testing. Especially on the execution time of your tests. Hint it cannot
be fast enough.

On how to structure a test I suggest [Arrange Act Assert in Wards Wiki](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ArrangeActAssert) and
[Naming Test Classes and Methods by Sandro Mancuso](http://codurance.com/2014/12/13/naming-test-classes-and-methods/)

An excellent talk on [Boundaries by Gary Bernhardt](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries) where he goes
 into the issues with using test doubles aka. mocks.
 
To avoid testing the wrong stuff have a look at [The Magic Tricks of Testing by Sandi Metz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URSWYvyc42M)
and [J.B. Rainsberger - Integrated Tests Are A Scam](https://vimeo.com/80533536)
