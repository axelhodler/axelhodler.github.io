People call me Axel, I'm located in [Stuttgart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttgart), I [code](https://github.com/xorrr) and adhere to the [NAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle).

Currently I enjoy working with Java, ember.js and mongoDB. After seeing a screenshot of [xmonad](http://xmonad.org/) I dove straight into Linux and became an [Archlinux](https://www.archlinux.org/) user in 2011. Dual-booting is bloat and [Emacs](http://xkcd.com/378/) is easier to quit.

Besides coding I [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17724008-xorrr), improve my [Spanish](https://www.duolingo.com/xorrr), cook every day and mostly eat [paleo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleo_diet). I'm into jogging and bodyweight exercises, meanwhile I listen to a multitude of podcasts. Oh and if a movie has a rating above 7 on [imdb](http://www.imdb.com/) chances are I've seen it.
