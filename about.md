Hi there! I'm Axel. I solve problems. By asking the right questions and with [code](https://github.com/axelhodler).

Both in life and during software development I enjoy short feedback loops, doing what works, ditching what does not and trying to find out how to improve.

I [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17724008-axel), keep up on the cryptocurrency ecosystem and cook almost every day. On the go I listen to a multitude of podcasts. If a movie has a rating above 7 on [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/) I've most likely watched it.

Mid 2016 I co-founded [blockLAB Stuttgart](http://blocklab.de/) a network for Blockchain-Technology and the [Blockchain Technology Meetup Stuttgart](https://www.meetup.com/Blockchain-meetup/).

The posts serve as a collection of a few of the things I have learned over the years. Putting the lessons learned into words might serve as a reference for my future self and hopefully a few other fellow travelers.
