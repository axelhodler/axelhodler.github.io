Hi, I'm Axel, located in [Stuttgart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttgart) and I [code](https://github.com/axelhodler).

Both in life and during software development I enjoy short feedback loops, doing what works, ditching what does not and trying to find out how to improve.

Besides coding i [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17724008-xorrr), keep up on the cryptocurrency ecosystem and cook almost every day. On the go I listen to a multitude of podcasts. If a movie has a rating above 7 on [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/) I've most likely watched it.

I'm a Co-Founder of [blockLAB Stuttgart](http://blocklab.de/) a network for Blockchain-Technology and Co-Organizer of the [Blockchain Technology and Decentralized Computing Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/blockchain_technology/).
