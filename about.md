Some call me Axel. I'm located in [Stuttgart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttgart) and I [code](https://github.com/axelhodler).

Both in life and during software development i enjoy short feedback loops, doing what works, ditching what does not and trying to find out how to improve.

Besides coding i [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17724008-xorrr), do stir-fry cooking with my wok, keep up on the cryptocurrency ecosystem. On the go I listen to a multitude of podcasts. If a movie has a rating above 7 on [imdb](http://www.imdb.com/) I've most likely watched it.
