Hi there! I'm Axel. I solve problems. By asking questions and with [code](https://github.com/axelhodler).

Both in life and during software development I enjoy short feedback loops, doing what works, ditching what does not and trying to find out how to improve.

I [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17724008-axel) and cook almost every day. On the go I listen to a multitude of podcasts. If a movie has a rating above 7 on [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/) I've most likely watched it.
I'm into health, especially longevity, fitness (HIIT & BJJ) and food.

The posts serve as a collection of a few of the things I have learned over the years. Putting the lessons learned into words might serve as a reference for my future self and hopefully a few other fellow travelers.

The page is using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
