Some call me Axel. I'm located in [Stuttgart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttgart) and I [code](https://github.com/xorrr).

I currently enjoy working with Java, ember.js and mongoDB. After stepping upon a screenshot of [xmonad](http://xmonad.org/) I dove straight into Linux and became an avid [Archlinux](https://www.archlinux.org/) user in 2011. Dual-booting is bloat and [Emacs](http://xkcd.com/378/) is easier to quit :)

Besides coding I [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17724008-xorrr), improve my [Spanish](https://www.duolingo.com/xorrr), cook and eat primarily [paleo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleo_diet) and am a proponent of the [NAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle). I'm into cryptocurrencies and keep busy by jogging and doing bodyweight exercises. On the go I listen to a multitude of podcasts. If a movie has a rating above 7 on [imdb](http://www.imdb.com/) I've most likely watched it.
