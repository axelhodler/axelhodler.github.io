A little more than a month ago i've been to Japan with three friends. As the related blogpost is already long overdue I guess I'll get right into it. Maybe this post will be of purpose to someone looking for pointers while planning their journey to the Land of the Rising Sun. Nevertheless I'm trying to keep it short as it's my first blogpost ever... Yeah welcome to the year 2013 r'tard ;)

We drove around using the JR-pass and the local subways and busses. When making reservations for the Shinkansen it's best to make use of the [Hyperdia App](http://www.hyperdia.com/). Just open the connection you'd like to use on the display and show it to the staff. They will print the tickets and book the seat-reservations. If you're ever short of money just skip some of the temples and castles (philistines might blabber "if you've seen one of them you've seen all of 'em"). Rather use the money for the different parks which were visited by a lot less people and were inviting you to just sit there and marvel at the surroundings.

The following is a map of were we've been. We used 18 days for the route, 4 of these we spent in Tokyo.

### The best parts were:

* Miyajima: Definetly climb to the top. Awesome view on the surrounding area from multiple spots. The ferry is part of the JR-Line which makes the visit it free for JR-pass owners.
* Hiroshima: The city had a nice calm feeling to it. Really liked to saunter around. Only saw more fixies in Shibuya Tokyo.
* The food: I'd suggest you try everything you can get your hands on. If you don't like fish its probably because the few you tried were fucked up by the cook. Don't miss out on the local specialities. (wikivoyage is your friend!)
* The culture: Well, as usual, there are things you can learn from and things that don't make any sense whatsoever. I guess the decision is up to you.

Well for planning I recommend the [Japan Guide Travel Essentials](http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e623b.html) and the Japan articles on the different cities on [Wikivoyage](http://en.wikivoyage.org), the recommendations concerning the food were awesome.
