[Hamcrest](http://hamcrest.org/JavaHamcrest/) is a framework that assists in writing tests. The benefit of using Hamcrest is that the created assertions read more like written sentences and should help you to quickly grasp what a test is asserting.

In case you are wondering where the name comes from or what it has to do with ham: _Hamcrest_ is an [anagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram) of _matchers_.

Instead of using the `assertEquals` assertion you would use the `assertThat` assertion.
{% highlight java %}
assertEquals("Frank", user.getName());
assertThat(user.getName(), is("Frank"));
{% endhighlight %}

Put into a sentence the first reads as:

> assert equals frank username

While the latter reads as:

> assert that username is frank

In my opinion the last one is easier and faster to understand.

Another difference you might have spotted is that the order of arguments has changed. While `assertEquals` uses the `expected` part as its first argument, `assertThat` is using the `actual` as its first.

With Hamcrest you will also get a different response when the test fails.

{% highlight java %}
assertEquals("Peter", user.getName());
{% endhighlight %}

yields the following response:

```
org.junit.ComparisonFailure: expected:<[Peter]> but was:<[Frank]>
```

On the other hand:

{% highlight java %}
assertThat(user.getName, is("Peter"));
{% endhighlight %}

leads to:

```
java.lang.AssertionError:
Expected: is "Peter"
     but: was "Frank"
```

I regard it as easier to compare the two strings vertically than horizontally. Especially when they become longer than just a few characters.

In case you are wondering what `is` actually does. It is just a wrapper that doesn't add any extra behaviour to the underlying matcher. In case of using it like `is("Frank")` it's actually doing `is(equalTo("Frank"))`. The follow assertions are thus all equivalent.

{% highlight java %}
assertThat(user.getName(), is("Frank"));
assertThat(user.getName(), equalTo("Frank"));
assertThat(user.getName(), is(equalTo("Frank")));
{% endhighlight %}

The are a lot more matchers that can be combined such as

{% highlight java %}
assertThat(user.getName(), not(containsString("Professor")));
{% endhighlight %}

Check the [documentation](http://hamcrest.org/JavaHamcrest/javadoc/1.3/org/hamcrest/Matchers.html) for more. If these are not enough you can also build your own custom matchers.

Hamcrest core ships with JUnit. Should your project already use JUnit, which i would regard as a must, you can get started with Hamcrest right away.
